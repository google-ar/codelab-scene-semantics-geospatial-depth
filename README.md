# ARCore Scene Semantics and Geospatial Depth Codelab project

This repository contains the template used for the [Get started with the Scene Semantics and Geospatial Depth APIs Codelab](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-scene-semantics-geospatial-depth#0).

This repository contains the following branches:

* `main`, the starting point of the codelab;
* `step-3`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 3: Visualize Scene Semantics API data](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-scene-semantics-geospatial-depth#2);
* `step-4`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 4: Visualize Geospatial Depth API data](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-scene-semantics-geospatial-depth#3).

If you get stuck at any point in the codelab, use `git checkout` to check out the correct code so you can move on.
